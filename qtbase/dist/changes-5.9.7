   been replaced by the Qt License Agreement 4.0 text. This makes it
   explicit that commercial customers of The Qt Company can use the git
   version under commercial terms. However, support is (still) only
   provided for builds from released branches of Qt.

 - macOS:
   * The Qt 5.9 series is not compatible with Xcode 10 or the macOS 10.14 SDK.
     Building your application against the 10.14 SDK will result in opting in
     to features such as dark mode, and layer backed views, which are not
     supported by Qt 5.9.x. Please build against the 10.13 SDK instead,
     which is available though Xcode 9.
